RUN THE CODE as: G3R_v2023.exe < CDR.txt (where G3R_v2023.exe is the executable)

FIRST LINE:
     Iwr =writing index, +1 => coordnates are written , -1 no coords
     NS = number of steps / period of inner binary
     IST = output after every IST steps
     max_outer = maximum time (in periods of outer binary)
     a1 =1      these "a" are method parameters. 
     a2 =15     see Mikkola 1997 CemDA 67:145-165

     clight= speed of light. If M_sun=1 , G=1 ,a_Earth=1, then approx c=10^4
     NOTE: if you set: clight=0 => no relativistic terms
    
SECOND LINE:
    m1, m2, m3 -- masses of components

THIRD LINE:    
    a , e , i, M_0, \Omega, \omega for the inner orbit

FOURTH LINE:
    a,  e , i, M_0, \Omega , \omega for the outer orbit


    The code prints  some errors & other info on standard output
    and to the file 'taei' orbital elements:
    write(91,191)ytime,a12,e12,inc12,a3,e3,inc3,ainc,oo12 ! write some elemets
    ytime=years
    a12 =inner a
    e12 =inner e
    inc12 =inner i
    a3,e3,inc3 in the same way
    HOWEVER: the inclinations are in the innertial system => mean 'nothing'
    (since affected by precessions)
    instead  look 'ainc' = mutual inclination of orbits
    oo12= inner \omega  (to make possible to check the relativistic precession)
                        (for Mercury the code gave 43" /100 years, i.e. correct)
